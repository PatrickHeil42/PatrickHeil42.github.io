  <h3>Home </h3>
  <p> 
  Welcome to my personal website! My name is Patrick; I'm a recent Comp Sci graduate, looking for work in IT.<br>
  I made this site to show off various personal projects. Some of these are from classes; others I made on my own.<br>
  This site and all it's code is posted on my <a href="https://github.com/PatrickHeil42/PatrickHeil42.github.io">github</a>. <br>
  
</p>
<br>

<h3> Site Map</h3>

<p>
This site is organized into 4 pages. <br>
<br>


  <div class="row align-items-start">
    <div class="col">
      <h2> Home</h2>
      The page you are on currently is the home page, or landing page. It displays information about the site and it's features. It can be accessed by selecting Home on the navigation bar at the top of the screen.
    </div>
    <div class="col">
     <h2> Weather</h2>
      The second page is the Weather Page. It displays a weather forecast for your location using the TomTom API and the OpenWeatherMap API. This page can be accessed by selecting Weather on the navigation bar.
    </div>
   
    <div class="col">
     <h2> Satellite </h2>
     This project took the longest by far but I'm happy with how it turned out. 
     Ever since I started working with API's I've wanted to find a public satellite imagery API and hook something up to it.
     I got caught up trying to find a free API I could use, missing the easy solution: the snapshot tool from <a href="https://worldview.earthdata.nasa.gov/">NASA's Worldview site</a>.
     If I had a server with the ability to run AJAX I'd load the images directly on the page but since we're on Github Pages you'll need to click the links yourself.
     Images are refreshed daily (except for the clear view, which refreshes every ten minutes!). <a href="https://opensource.gsfc.nasa.gov/nosa.php">All images courtesy of NASA.</a>
     </div>
  </div>
  <div class="row align-items-start">
    <div class="col">
      <h2> P5.js </h2>
      The fourth page is a javascript (art?) project. I made it using the p5.js library; it draws circles using a grid.
